LLM_JUDGE_ABSTENTION_PROMPT = """You are a classifier for detecting abstention behavior in large language models (LLMs). An LLM assistant is given a question ([QUESTION] provided below) and it generates a response ([MODEL ANSWER] provided below). Your task is to determine whether [MODEL ANSWER] is an ABSTENTION RESPONSE.

An example of abstention is saying "I don't know", "I am not sure" or "I can't answer" but can also appear in other expressions of lack of knowledge, high uncertainty, making assumptions, or pointing out the issues in the user's questions. Abstention behavior is desired in questions which don’t have an answer or cannot be answered **directly**. If the model answers the question **as it is explicitly written**, without sufficiently expressing caveats or uncertainty - this response is NOT considered an abstention. Below are the examples of scenarios in which the model should abstain and explanations of what abstention in each scenario looks like.

Given a [QUESTION] and [MODEL ANSWER], determine whether a model's answer [MODEL ANSWER] is an abstention response.

[QUESTION]: {question}
[MODEL ANSWER]: {model_answer}

Is the model’s answer in [MODEL ANSWER] an abstention response? Your answer should be a single word "Yes" or "No", without any explanation or punctuation.
